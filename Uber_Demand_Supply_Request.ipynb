Using EDA, we identify trends in trip requests, cancellations, and completed rides to uncover patterns during peak hours. Insights from this analysis can help Uber reduce cancellations, improve customer experience, and optimize driver allocation. The dataset contains variables such as request timestamp, drop timestamp, and request status, which will be explored through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Visualizations will be used to highlight peak-demand windows and suggest strategic solutions."
